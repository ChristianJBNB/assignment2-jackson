# Christian Jackson

My name is Christian Jackson, and I am a senior at Northwest Missouri State University. I am studying both computer science and cybersecurity. While taking classes I am also studying for certifications that I hope to use when I get a job in security. I hope that one day I can be a freelance security analysist or work on an incident response team.
